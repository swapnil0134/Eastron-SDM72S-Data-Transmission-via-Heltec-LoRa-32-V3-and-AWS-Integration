# Eastron-SDM72S-Data-Transmission-via-LoRa-and-AWS-Integration
The project aims to read data from an SDM72S energy meter using Modbus protocol, transmit this data over LoRa using Heltec LoRa v3 modules, and then handle the data with a Raspberry Pi 4 by saving it locally and forwarding it to AWS for further processing and storage.
